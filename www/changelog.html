        <h2>BetterPonymotes Changelog</h2>
        <p>This changelog only lists code changes. Most releases contain whatever
        emote updates were available at the time, and are not mentioned.

        <h5>v49.79 - 2012-11-23</h5>
        <p>GIF animote fixes, disable MutationObserver on Chrome due to bug,
        and compatibility with the development version of RES.

        <h5>v47.78 - 2012-11-21</h5>
        <p>Include support for animotes on Chrome, by converting APNG's to GIF
        and hosting them externally.

        <h5>v46.75 - 2012-11-07</h5>
        <p>Bugfix: custom css was being applied globally even when global emotes
        were disabled.

        <h5>v45.71 - 2012-10-28</h5>
        <p>Add click toggle option.
        <p>Improved options page.
        <p>Search box handles focus better.
        <p>Alt-text converter now procesess embedded links.
        <p>Implemented <code>r/</code> search syntax and negative subreddit queries.

        <h5>v44.70 - 2012-10-27</h5>
        <p>Fix z-index problems with the search box and make the width of the
        results area stop changing size so badly.
        <p>Lots of random internal cleanup.

        <h5>v43.69 - 2012-10-25</h5>
        <p>Extra CSS detection now works by introspecting the available
        CSSStyleDeclaration object for properties. Should mean UserScripts are
        now supported.
        <p>Set a minimum Chrome browser version in the manifest, so outdated
        users will stop wondering why it doesn't work (and probably start
        wondering why it doesn't install).
        <p>Special case <code>+formatting</code> to add text in the search box.
        No longer hiding these emotes.
        <p>Fix global emotes bug, not deleting old nodes properly.
        <p>Slim down the search box.
        <p>Don't convert alt-text or unknown emotes on sidebars. Helps some
        subreddits.

        <h5>v40.65 - 2012-10-21</h5>
        <p>Improve unknown emote detection. Handles sidebars better.
        <p>Add notifications when the user is using emotes in such a way that
        non-script users will have problems with the post. (Alt-text in
        non-native emotes, and "blank posts".) Includes an option to disable.

        <h5>v39.64 - 2012-10-21</h5>
        <p>Optimized global emote converter. It now runs nodes in batches of
        1000 with a custom tree walker, and doesn't trawl the DOM for scroll
        information unless absolutely necessary. Fixes problems where BPM would
        seem to hang on larger pages.

        <h5>v38.63 - 2012-10-19</h5>
        <p>Fixed merged emotes being missing.
        <p>Minor optimizations.
        <p>Global emote converter now tries to automatically scroll enclosing
        elements where applicable. This makes chat windows far more tolerable.
        <p>Alt-text is now converted globally.
        <p>Restyled disabled/nsfw/unknown emote placeholders to be substantially
        less annoying (they're inline now).

        <h5>v37.62.1 - 2012-10-16</h5>
        <p>Fixed more bugs in results counting. Tag negation and default tags
        are thorny.

        <h5>v37.62 - 2012-10-16</h5>
        <p>Fixed results counting. No longer counts doubled emotes (as a result
        of variant omission) and shows the effects of hidden-by-default emotes.

        <h5>v36.61 - 2012-10-15</h5>
        <p>Tag search matches against +v emotes, before replacing them with their
        base equivalent. This makes it possible to search for variant emote names.
        <p>Negative tag search implemented. You can now search for things like
        <code>+mane -ts -rarity</code> and get just the non-unicorn Mane 6.
        <p>Default search set to <code>-nonpony -hidden</code>.

        <h5>v35.60 - 2012-10-13</h5>
        <p>Emote tags. Every emote has been tagged according to its content.
        Several tools written to process that data and all of it included in
        BPM.
        <p>Variant tags- all extra aliases are tagged <code>+v</code>, and
        hidden from search output. Several other emotes have been hidden as
        well.
        <p>Emote file format overhauled.
        <p>Backend significantly rewritten to compensate.
        <p>Addon data files combined and restructured. Data now encoded in short
        strings for sake of memory.
        <p>PONYSCRIPT-IGNORE is now selectively disrespected. Used on r/mlplounge.
        <p>Rules file restructured. Tags now used to implement many of its
        previous purposes.
        <p>"BetterPonymotes Extras" has been removed.
        <p>Lots of other internal changes.
        <p>Tag search on emotes.

        <h5>v34.58 - 2012-10-07</h5>
        <p>Options support for the userscript variant, using postMessage().
        <p>Stylistic improvements on emote placeholders.

        <h5>v33.57 - 2012-10-06</h5>
        <p>Rewrite frame code. BPM now runs the search exclusively in top-level
        frames, delegating focus tracking and emote injection to frames as
        necessary.
        <p>Emote regexps made more consistent.

        <h5>v32.56 - 2012-10-05</h5>
        <p>Minor fixes for Opera (custom css wasn't downloading) and Safari
        (wasn't running at all)
        <p>Custom CSS now works globally, and better in general.

        <h5>v31.55 - 2012-10-04</h5>
        <p>Fall back on DOMNodeInserted more reliably, and on all browsers. Fix
        for Firefox nightly.
        <p>Fix frame detection on Firefox. Makes Tumblr work better, for real
        this time.
        <p>Dragging the search box around no longer selects anything on Firefox
        and Chrome. Some other elements still show signs of being selected on
        Opera.
        <p>Fixed alt-text converter running on freshly-made posts twice, and so
        expanding its own source info text.

        <h5>v30.54 - 2012-10-03</h5>
        <p>Safari fixes: emotes button doesn't submit form, code that depends on
        DOMContentLoaded is more reliably fired.
        <p>Frames on Chrome now behave as they do on other browsers.

        <h5>v29.53 - 2012-10-02</h5>
        <p>Made global search button go on top of more things.
        <p>Global search button responds to Command on Macs.
        <p>Fixed a random hovermote or two.
        <p>A good bit of unreleased work toward userscripts.
        <p>Added a couple spoiler emotes I didn't know about.
        <p>Add option to hide disabled emotes completely.
        <p>Make disabled NSFW emotes more strongly disabled, so subreddits don't
        override them.

        <h5>v29.52 - 2012-10-01</h5>
        <p>Cache control set on CSS host (for userscripts).
        <p>Fixed global search button a bit- it goes on top of things better.
        <p>Made it work in Scriptish (document.head is not defined early on).
        <p>Global search button respects both Ctrl and Meta/Command for dragging
        now. An improvement for Mac users.
        <p>Fixed a couple random hovermotes.

        <h5>v28.52 - 2012-09-30</h5>
        <p>Ignores a couple of hard-coded spoiler tags when expanding alt-text.
        <p>Fixed the custom CSS feature not being able to download new files on
        Chrome.
        <p>Fixed the emote blacklist input boxes, again. Pressing enter doesn't
        "submit" the page anymore. Maybe for good this time!
        <p>Custom CSS handles nonexistent subreddits better now- Reddit no longer
        seems to return a 404, so it checks that the Content-Type is text/css.
        <p>Figured out how to make the search input the right size on Chrome.
        <p>Basic UserScript support. Core functionality tested on GreaseMonkey.

        <h5>v27.51 - 2012-09-29</h5>
        <p>Corrected tabbing order with the emotes button- instead of coming
        before save, is now out of the tab order entirely. This sucks, but a
        proper fix requires messing with the save button a little bit.
        <p>Gave up on the sourceinfo bubbles and moved it to alt-text, like
        GrEmB did.
        <p>CSS is a few kb smaller by omitting <code>clear: none</code>.

        <h5>v26.51 - 2012-09-29</h5>
        <p>Fixed emote injection from the search box, which was broken by the
        removal of text in the last release.
        <p>Made the <code>-i</code> (invert) flag work on Firefox and Chrome.
        Chrome uses CSS, Firefox requires a small hack with SVG filters, and
        Opera doesn't seem to support either mechanism.
        <p>Removed global emotes button from frames when on Reddit. Helps with
        certain kinds of addons.

        <h5>v25.50 - 2012-09-29</h5>
        <p>Moved the Chrome version to the webstore.
        <p>Global emotes imply the <code>-in</code> flag, as a formatting fix.
        <p>Added an option to show emote search globally (hidden behind a small
        icon).
        <p>The search box now remembers the last thing you searched on. It
        defaults to <code>sr:mylittlepony</code> as a convenience, so it's not
        blank when you open it.
        <p>Removed the emote name from the search results, so it's easier to
        see the emote. (It's in the title text anyway, so not missing.)
        <p>Hovering over an emote now shows source information in a small pop-up
        box.

        <h5>v24.48 - 2012-09-24</h5>
        <p>Continued cleanup by fixing up options.js.
        <p>Fixed another problem with RES's new "feature". BPM ignored the user
        tag link, but not the votes display as I had not seen it used yet.
        <p>Custom CSS download code now spaces out its requests to Reddit, in
        accordance with their rules.

        <h5>v24.46 - 2012-09-20</h5>
        <p>Massive cleanup effort began- main script essentially rewritten as
        far as diffs go. Script concern areas split apart a bit, and a few
        long-standing messes fixed.
        <p>Firefox now uses the postMessage API instead of self.port, for
        consistency.
        <p>Fixed emote converter and alt-text code running on links more than
        once when they were added to the page with "load more comments".
        <p>Made writing prefs from the frontend script (specifically the emote
        window positioning) not blow away prefs written from other sources-
        particularly, the options page. Also may have improved lag.

        <h5>v22.45 - 2012-09-18</h5>
        <p>Made combiners turn off better- if you had r/mylittlecombiners
        disabled, but NSFW on, they would still move emotes around as if they
        were on. This has been mostly fixed (they still still react to
        pinkiepies).
        <p>Reworked preferences code a bit. Chrome/Opera now redirect writes
        from options.html through background.js. Some common code was pulled
        out. This enables backends to respond to prefs changes on all browsers.
        <p>Fixed an overflow problem in the emote list widgets- with a large
        number of emotes, the boxes generated for them would fall out of the
        &lt;div&gt;.
        <p>Added a custom CSS feature- BPM will apply the raw CSS from the
        specified subreddits. The parser used strips out most non-emote stuff.
        CSS is updated once a week, or when forced. This feature is somewhat
        fragile at the moment, and should be used carefully.

        <h5>v21.44 - 2012-09-15</h5>
        <p>Added emote whitelist. Emotes listed here will override all forms of
        blacklisting.

        <h5>v20.44 - 2012-09-15</h5>
        <p>Added max emote size option. Blocks all emotes larger than this.
        <p>Made disabled emotes work better on their native subs (though use of
        !important tags will override us in turn, so this isn't perfect).
        <p>Emote blacklist added. Override specific emotes- more fine-grained
        than by subreddit.
        <p>Click blocker added. Makes emotes behave less like links.

        <h5>v19.43 - 2012-09-13</h5>
        <p>(Despite being marked as an emote-only release, this version contains
        core code changes. However, none of this is user-visible.)
        <p>Removed MutationSummary library in favor of using MutationObserver
        directly. Some bugs may have been introduced as a consequence, as MS was
        quite smart about never reporting the same node twice.

        <h5>v19.42 - 2012-09-11</h5>
        <p>Made CSS application work uniformly across browsers, removing the
        need for all the !important tags BGM needed on Firefox. Also fixes
        subreddits overriding built-in emotes, especially r/mlplounge.
