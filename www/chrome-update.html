        <h2>An Announcement</h2>

        <p>If you're seeing this page, it means you're using BetterPonymotes on
        Chrome.

        <p>BetterPonymotes has recently moved to the Chrome webstore in order
        to make installation easier. Due to some complications, the easiest way
        to make sure you continue to receive upgrades is to reinstall from the
        new locatoin.

        <p>All you need to do to move to the new version is uninstall the
        one you have now, and either go
        <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bkkmhlceghomaajdimmejkhldnpleoea">
        here</a> to get the new one, or click this button:
        <button onclick="chrome.webstore.install()">Install</button>

        <p>Your preferences will be lost in the move, so make sure you check
        those.

        <p>My gratitude for your continued patience.
