          <p class="desc">
          <label class="checkbox"><input id="enableNSFW" type="checkbox"> Enable NSFW emotes</label>
          Several emotes in BetterPonymotes are strongly NSFW in nature, going as
          far as to be explicitly pornographic. This option does not cover every
          emote that you might consider questionable- with a handful of difficult
          exceptions, the emotes it blocks all contain actual genitalia.</p>

          <p class="desc">
          <label class="checkbox"><input id="enableExtraCSS" type="checkbox"> Enable extra emote modifiers</label>
          BetterPonymotes includes a copy of the Chaos script, a collection of
          flags and modifiers on emotes. These do things like make emotes spin
          in multiple dimensions. These can be problematic on some computers.</p>
          <p class="desc">Note that the 3D spin flags do not work on Opera.</p>

          <p class="desc">
          <label class="checkbox"><input id="showUnknownEmotes" type="checkbox"> Show placeholders for unknown emotes (may conflict with other emote scripts)</label>
          When BetterPonymotes encounters a link that appears to be an emote, but
          it doesn't know about it, it generates a small placeholder to show you.
          This can conflict if you have other emote scripts that are converting
          the emotes- as BPM doesn't know about these. Turn this off if you hare
          having conflict problems.</p>

          <p class="desc">
          <label class="checkbox"><input id="hideDisabledEmotes" type="checkbox"> Hide disabled emotes completely (no placeholders)</label>
          When BPM encounters an emote you have disabled through any means, it
          generates a small placeholder. This option turns them off, trying to
          make them seem to be nonexistent.</p>

          <p class="desc">
          <label class="checkbox"><input id="showAltText" type="checkbox"> Reveal hidden alt-text</label>
          This option controls the alt-text expander, which displays alt-text on
          emotes next to the image. When BPM does this, it also replaces the
          actual alt-text with emote information, including its name and where it
          comes from.</p>

          <p class="desc">
          <label class="checkbox"><input id="enableGlobalEmotes" type="checkbox"> Convert emotes outside of Reddit</label>
          Enables the global emote converter. BPM will scan every page you visit
          for text that looks like <code>[]<!---->(/emote)</code> and attempt to
          convert it into real emotes.</p>

          <p class="desc">
          <label class="checkbox"><input id="enableGlobalSearch" type="checkbox"> Show the emote search globally</label>
          Shows a small box on every page to bring up the emote search, for use
          with global emote conversion. You can hold Ctrl down to drag the box
          around.</p>

          <p class="desc">
          <label class="checkbox"><input id="warnCourtesy" type="checkbox"> Enable courtesy notifications</label>
          This option enables small, unobtrusive notifications when BPM notices
          you are writing a post that people without scripts may not be able to
          see at all, which is considered a breach of etiquette.</p>

          <p class="desc">
          <label class="checkbox"><input id="clickToggleSFW" type="checkbox"> When I click a disabled emote, only show SFW emotes</label>
          When BPM disables an emote and leaves a placeholder, you can click on
          it to expand it in order to see what it is. Ordinarily, BPM will refuse
          to do this for NSFW emotes. This option disables that check.</p>

          <p class="desc">
          <label>Search result limit: <input id="searchLimit" type="text"> (high values may slow down search)</label>
          BPM has nearly 7000 emotes, and some search queries return very large
          numbers of these. Since this tends to slow down browsers, this option
          controls the maximum number of results BPM will return at a time.</p>

          <p class="desc">
          <!--
            Would be nice to use Bootstrap's input-append/add-on "px", but this
            screws up alignment somehow.
          -->
          <label>Maximum emote size: <input id="maxEmoteSize" type="text"> (zero is no limit)</label>
          Emotes larger than this size will be disabled. This can help if you
          find some of the more massive emotes in BPM annoying.</p>
