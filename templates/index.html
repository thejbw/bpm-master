        <h2>Rules and Basic Tags</h2>
        <p>The following set of basic tags should be adhered to. Some of these
          will have important meanings in the future.
        <p>The Mane Six's tags are <code>+twilightsparkle</code>, <code>+rarity</code>,
          <code>+rainbowdash</code>, <code>+fluttershy</code>, <code>+pinkiepie</code>,
          and <code>+applejack</code>.
        <p>Add any and all extra tags you can think of (within reason)- but be
          careful not to introduce multiple tags for the same thing. Tag aliases
          can be implemented at a later date- just pick one, and stick with it.
        <p>All explicitly pornographic emotes must be tagged <code>+nsfw</code>.
          Anything less than actual genitalia is most likely not NSFW.
        <p>Emotes that strongly imply genitalia, sex, or similar (e.g. the
          <code>/*fun</code> emotes, or most of r/mylittlenanners) should be
          tagged as <code>+questionable</code>, i.e. "questionably sfw".
          Though this "rating" is not currently implemented in BPM, plans do
          exist. It does <em>not</em> include emotes like the <code>/yy*</code>
          set, or "sexy face" emotes. Take a strong stance on this rule- when in
          doubt, interpret it as literally as possible. Bend it as little as you
          can.
        <p>If an emote is merely a reversed version of another emote, or an
          alias, mark it as <code>+v</code> (variant). This includes <code>/r*</code>.
          grid names, and most non-canonical aliases. Ideally, every emote has
          only one non-variant alias. Variant emotes will be hidden from search
          to reduce clutter, and used to find identical emotes. Don't tag these
          emotes with anything else- other tags will be automatically added in
          later by finding non-variant emotes. Only use this to mark variants
          within a single subreddit- if an emote is a copy from elsewhere, just
          tag it as normal.
        <p>r/mylittlepony emotes are marked as <code>+drop</code>. Don't remove
          this tag, or <strong>do not</strong> use it anywhere else. It has
          special meaning.

        <h4>Use of Specific Tags</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><code>+human</code> is for humanized ponies, not actual humans.
            Humans from the show (only applies to older generations) also apply.
          <li><code>+nonpony</code> is for emotes with no relation to the show.
            It doesn't mean "no ponies in the emote".
          <li><code>+cmc</code> is to be replaced with <code>+sweetiebelle
            +scootaloo +applebloom</code> and removed.
          <li><code>+oc</code> is for OC's. No, you don't get your own tag.
            Maybe some other day.
          <li><code>+otherpony</code> is for canon ponies (in the show) that
            don't have their own tag. Generally, unless the pony has a large
            number of emotes to their name, you shouldn't give them their own
            tag.
          <li><code>+misc</code> is for when no other tag applies. Generally,
            this means objects from the show without any ponies in them (if it's
            not from the show, it's <code>+nonpony</code>).
          <li><code>+mashup</code> is for "modified" ponies- e.g. a Pikachu/Pinkie
            Pie hybrid.
        </ul>
